# Intro to Embedded Systems

**Introduction**

This is the code base for my first embedded systems project. Some crucial files like ports.c were supplied by 
the teacher, Jim Carlson from North Carolina State University; however, most of the code is original and built
from the ground up. 

This code base contains the entirety of the ECE 306 semester. The class was mainly project based. Each project 
propagated on earlier ones, and by the end of the course, I had a car that could autonomously follow a black line 
or receive commands through WiFi. 

I have come a long way since this coding this project back in 2016. There are MANY design changes I would make,
though I do look back fondly on the late nights learning the concepts and strategies necessary to complete the design.

This code was designed on a Texus Instruments MSP-430 MCU and was written in IAR Embedded Workbench.
